# 🌍 Air Quality Monitoring ETL Pipeline

This project is an automated ETL pipeline built to monitor PM2.5 air quality data from the OpenAQ API.  
I implemented the pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook environment (Google Colab), allowing dynamic analysis and real-time data extraction.

## 🔹 Features:
- API data extraction from OpenAQ.
- Cleaning and transforming nested sensor data.
- Filtering Indian PM2.5 sensor locations.
- Saving data to CSV.
- Interactive visualizations (bar chart + map).

## 🔹 Tech Stack:
- Python
- Pandas
- Requests
- Matplotlib
- Folium
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

## 🚀 Future Work:
- Automate daily runs using cron or Airflow.
- Deploy as a Streamlit app.
- Add historical air quality analysis.

## ✅ How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook (`Air_Quality_ETL_Pipeline.ipynb`).
3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
4. Run all cells.
